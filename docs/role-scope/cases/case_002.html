          After reviewing the license scope, disclosure history, and milestone performance,
          the tribunal finds (i) the claimant failed to establish a <em>material breach</em> of
          the Technology License Agreement; (ii) portions of the respondent’s counterclaim are
          supported by evidence of missed deliverables and underperformance against milestones
          M2–M3; (iii) royalty reporting discrepancies were cured within the contractual cure
          window and therefore do not constitute independent grounds for termination.
          Accordingly, the main claim is dismissed while the counterclaim is partially upheld
          with quantified adjustments specified in the award.

          The tribunal dismissed the main claim for lack of proof of material breach.
          Parts of the counterclaim were upheld based on milestone underperformance.
          Full reasoning is restricted to parties and arbitrators.
